<li>  Homework 11 : We'll go over some of these in class after break.
<ul>
<li>  Chapter 8: 39, 44, 45, 47. Chapter 9: 4, 20, 21, 22, 24
<li> (2nd. ed.)Chapter 8: 24, 28, 29, 31. Ch.9 4, 13, 14, 15, 17
<br><br>

<li> Given S={-5,-3,1,2,5,7,8,13,17}; Find the equivalence<br> classes of R on S, where aRb (a related to b) whenever a is congruent to b mod 6.
<br><br>
<li> On a set S with |S|=n, find a formula for the number of relations that are both reflexive and symmetric. 
<br><br>

Recall that the number of reflexive relations is 2^(n^2-n). <br>Maybe the best way to explain that is in terms of choices. Here’s a simpler problem: If you <br>have two choices of shirt (red and blue) and two choices of pants (black and tan) but  <br>only one pair of shoes, then how many outfits (one each of shirt, pants, pair of shoes) do you have?<br>  2x2x1=4. 
<br>
<br> The diagonal pairs (a,a) in a reflexive relation are like the shoes—you have to pick them <br>every time, so the counting principle turns into multiplying by 1 (only one choice.) <br>When we use the counting principle to count subsets the power of 2 comes from the <br> 2 choices “in” or  “out” for each possible element.  The diagonal pairs have to be “in”, so <br>we could see the formula as actually being 2^(n^2-n)x1x1…x1  where we mutiply by 2 for each non-diagonal pair and by <br>1 for each of the diagonal pairs. <br><br>

Alternatively you can say that choosing an outfit is the same as just choosing shirt and pants, <br>since the shoes are a given.  That's how we did the problem in class: just ignore the <br>diagonal pairs since they are a given!

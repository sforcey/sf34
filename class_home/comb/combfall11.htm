A great resource is wolfram|alpha. <br>

<font size="5"> Posters

<font size="3"> Here are the <a href="poster rules 2011.pdf"> 
instructions for the poster 
projects</a>, as mentioned in the syllabus.  Note the deadlines.
<br>
The poster session is:  Wednesday afternoon, November 30 in the <br> atrium of CAS during a 1 1/2 hour  slot between 2:00 - 5:30 PM
<br>NEW DUE DATE: Rough draft (electronic) Nov 16, final due date is actually Nov 18.<br> 
You'll need to turn in electronic files, so that I can get
 them printed in color and laminated. <br>Early completion is encouraged, so that you don't have to work over
 Thanksgiving (or while studying for test 2) <br>and so that I can tell you anything to change so as to get full credit!  
<br>
Two options for display: you can create a 42 inch long by 24 inch high single file (in Powerpoint or Adobe)<br>
 and I'll print and laminate the whole thing. 
OR 
you can create several smaller files designed to be placed on a trifold backing provided by myself:<br>
 it's 48 inches long by 36 inches high. The folds are vertical, 12 inches from either side,<br> so that the three panels are 12, 24 and 
12 inches long left to right.<br> 
Here are some <a href="comb_ideas.htm"> 
ideas for the poster. </a> <br>

Here is the grading <a href="comb_project.doc">  rubrik.</a> <br>

Here is a <a href="sample.ppt"> very nice sample </a> in the correct size, in powerpoint. <br>

Here is another <a href ="Hagenberg.pdf"> sample poster </a> I participated in creating.

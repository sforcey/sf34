<br> For integration, you can't beat <a href = "http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+x%5E2+sin%5E3+x+dx"> wolfram alpha </a>,
now providing 3d graphs of surfaces while finding
<a href = "http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+x%5E2+sin%5E3+y+dx+dy"> indefinite double integrals </a><br> and
<a href = "http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int+x%5E2+sin%5E3+y+dx+dy+x%3D0+to+3+y%3D1+to+4+"> definite double integrals </a>.<br>
Step by step solutions are available too:  3 a day with free account signup. <br>
Here is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int+%28x*e%5Ex%29%2Fy+dx+dy+y%3D1+to+2+x%3D0+to+1+"> another with e</a>.<br>

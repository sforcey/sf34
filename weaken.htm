Talk on weakened higher dimensional enrichment:
<HR>
In an enriched category A (over V) the role of composition is taken over by special morphisms in the monoidal
category V.
They appear as follows: 
</P>
<P>

M:A(Y,Z)\otimes A(X,Y) --> A(X,Z). 
</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Technical" SIZE=4><P>

I'll call a string of these hom-objects (such as the string of length two in the domain of M)
composable if they can be reduced to a single hom-object by repeated uses of M. Of course the parenthization of the original string matters.
 Keep in mind then also the associator in V, /alpha, used to get from one parenthization to another. For a string of length n
we can draw the associahedron K_n and put the various parenthizations at the vertexes, and the associators on the edges.

I define iterated enrichment in the sense that we enrich over V-Cat, the category of enriched categories over V, and etc.
I would like to weaken this concept.
The next slide reviews some of the paper and future plans.

The idea is that since, when enriching over V-n-Cat, composition morphisms 
</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Technical" SIZE=4><P>
M_1:U(B,C)\otimes U(A,B) -> U(A,C) 
</P>

are enriched n-functors, then the pentagon they are usually required to satisfy exactly can instead 
be filled in with an (invertible)
 enriched n-natural transformation M_2. Then we draw the pentagonal diagram of K_4 with
 vertices labeled by parenthesized strings of composable hom-objects, and compose each vertice by use of M_1 to a 
common final hom-object. What this does is to subdivide K_4 into two-cells that we fill in again with instances of M_2. 
We are now looking at a polyhedron with one of the pentagonal faces being K_4.
</P>
The next slide shows this process.

 There are exactly two 2-dimensional paths that make up the front
and back of the polyhedron. Between the latter there should now exist an enriched modification M_3.
The next slide shows the same polyhedron as in the flattened picture at the end of the last slide, but drawn in 3 dimensions.
</B></FONT><P><IMG SRC="weaken3.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE" width="500" height="458"   ></P>
 In general we continue 
subdividing associahedra with 
vertices labeled by composable hom-objects and filling in with a k-cell M_k until at last M_n+2 is 
an identity morphism--i.e. the 
last diagram made by composing the vertices of the last associahedron and filling in with M_n+1 is required to commute.</P>
The last slide shows just the beginning of the next step: I've filled in one of the quadrilaterals on K_5 to show that eventually an identity
3-cell will fit nicely into the wedge with the quadrilateral as its base and the final hom-object as its point.

Further work: see slides and pdf of my talk to the workshop on n-categories at the IMA. These include discussion of weak
enriched morphisms as well as an operad viewpoint.

Polymake for assymetric path polytope

CAVEATS
------------------------------------

	1)	Note that if you are using the browser-based polymake like me (http://shell.polymake.org/) you can copy from my stuff and paste into the browser  by right-clicking.  Be careful though because your browser/clipboard may insert line breaks, which mess it up for a big entry.  Paste into notepad first and remove them.  

	2)	I left the prompt “polytope >” in. Remove this.

	3)	Underscores like in F_VECTOR get removed sometimes and need replaced. Can be done in the pasting box in polymake.

	4)	I put the required initial “1” in each point.

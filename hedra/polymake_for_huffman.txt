CAVEATS
------------------------------------

	1)	Note that if you are using the browser-based polymake like me  (http://polymake.org/doku.php/boxdoc) or (http://shell.polymake.org/) you can copy from my stuff and paste into the browser  by right-clicking.  Be careful though because your browser/clipboard may insert line breaks, which mess it up for a big entry.  Paste into notepad first and remove them.  

	2)	I left the prompt “polytope >” in. Remove this.

	3)	Underscores like in F_VECTOR get removed sometimes and need replaced. Can be done in the pasting box in polymake.

	4)	The output below for VERTICES_IN_FACETS  gives lists of the vertices, numbered 0-14, based on the order they were entered.

		The pictures with the numbering 0-14 are here: http://www.math.uakron.edu/~sf34/bme_faces.pdf

		To see one of the 4d facets, you can go back and get those vertices from the original input, and make a new polytope with just those! For an example, see the facet from {0 2 3 4 7 14}
here: http://www.math.uakron.edu/~sf34/bme_faces.pdf

	5)	 I put the initial “1” in each point.

Some open questions.
How many posets are there, with n elements?
How many distinct combinatorial line arrangements are there, on the plane, using n lines?
How many plane arrangements are there, in 3D, using n planes?
How many finite topologies ae there,  with n elements?
How many graphs are there up to isomorphism on n nodes?
How many transitive relations are there on a set with n elements?
How many distinct combinatorial polytopes are there, in 3D, with n vertices?
How many nxn matrices are there, with {1,0} entries, and nonzero determinant?
(Do these matrices make a nice polytope?)
Is every even number >0 the sum of two primes?
Do two knots with n, m respective minimum crossings connect-sum to a knot with n+m crossing number?
(Compare: knot checkerboard coloring and strand diagrams!)
Can the triple connected sum of some knot (3 copies) be cobordant to the unknot? slice? ribbon?
Is every slice knot a ribbon knot? 
Are the nontrivial zeroes of the Riemann zeta function all on the line Re(z) =1/2?
Are there any entries of Pascal's triangle that appear more than 8 times? 
Is the diameter of a polytope always found by a polynomial using its number of facets and dimension?
Ramsey numbers. R(5,5)=?
Kobon triangles. K(10)=?
Happy ending numbers. f(7)=?
Is snaky a winner?
Can a thrackle have more edges than vertices? 
Does every convex polyhedron have a net?
How many nets does the n-dimensional hypercube have?
Is the Mandlebrot set path-connected?
Are multiassociahedra polytopes? (Does Loday's realization generalize?)
Are  pseudograph-multiplihedra polytopes? Poset multiplihedra? 
(Check whether Doker, Ardila settled this.)

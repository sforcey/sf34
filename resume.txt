Education:	-High School:  L.C.A., Lynchburg, VA GPA 4.0
		-Undergraduate:  Liberty University GPA 4.0 	
		Degree:  B.S. in Mathematics with Computer Science 
		concentration.
		-Graduate: currently enrolled in master's program at
		 Virginia Tech.
 		 Department : Mathematics; program: Mathematical Physics.
		-Math, Physics, Computer Science courses: see attachment.

Computer:	-Experienced in programming in BASIC, PASCAL, PROLOG, LISP, 
 		C++, and UNIX. Experienced in use of MSDOS, MS Office, Windows
		95, WordPerfect, Mac OS 8.1, Eudora Light, CCMail, 
		and other applications.

Experience:	-Framatome Technologies, Lynchburg VA. Job description included 
		comparisons of, predictions  of, and extrapolation from data
		measured in the reactor cores of nuclear power plants.
		 Familiar with Nodal expansion method , cross section
		generating, and decay/shuffle codes  from work on reactor core
		reports and high level waste research.
			(Jan. 1996 - Aug. 1997)

		-Camp counselor, life guard and bus driver for Thomas Rd.
		 Baptist Church, Lynchburg VA.	
			(Summer 1995, 1996)

		-Life guard for Sandusky Swim Club, Lynchburg VA.
			(Summer 1994)

		-Volunteer  assistance in preparing graphs of data related to
		accelerator experiments  for Dr. M.T. Pigott at Los Alamos 
		National Laboratory. I received minimal work experience here;
		but  my interest  in science was sparked by being around 
		scientists.
			(Summer 1991)

Professional
Interest:	-I have a strong interest in physics and mathematics, as well
		 as the use of computers in solving problems. I am especially 
		 interested in scientific research, but enjoy  problem solving
		 of almost any kind.
